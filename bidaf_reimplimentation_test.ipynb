decision problem, it is the problem of deciding whether the input has a factor less than k. no efficient integer factorization algorithm is known, and this fact forms the basis of several modern cryptographic systems, such as the rsa algorithm. the integer factorization problem is in np and in co-np (and even in up and co-up). if the problem is np-complete, the polynomial time hierarchy will collapse to its first level (i.e., np will equal co-np). the best known algorithm for integer factorization is the general number field sieve, which takes time o(e(64/9)1/3(n.log 2)1/3(log (n.log 2))2/3) to factor an n-bit integer. however, the best known quantum algorithm for this problem, shor's algorithm, does run in polynomial time. unfortunately, this fact doesn't say much about where the problem lies with respect to non-quantum complexity classes.\",\n          \"victorian schools are either publicly or privately funded. public schools, also known as state or government schools, are

primary and secondary schools. private schools also receive some public funding. all schools must comply with government-set curriculum standards. in addition, victoria has four government selective schools, melbourne high school for boys, macrobertson girls' high school for girls, the coeducational schools john monash science school, nossal high school and suzanne cory high school, and the
