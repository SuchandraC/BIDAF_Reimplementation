# BiDAF (Bidirectional Attention Flow) Reimplementation

This repository contains my reimplementation of the BiDAF (Bidirectional Attention Flow) model, originally introduced by Seo et al. for machine comprehension tasks. The BiDAF model combines bidirectional attention flow with RNNs to effectively model the interactions between context and query, achieving high accuracy on machine reading comprehension tasks.

Overview
BiDAF is designed to handle machine comprehension tasks by learning complex, contextual interactions between a query and a context passage. It applies a unique attention mechanism to capture the bidirectional influence of context on query and vice versa, enabling the model to pinpoint answers more accurately.

Key Features
Bidirectional Attention Flow to capture context-query interactions.
Embedding Layers for efficient word representation.
Recurrent Layers (Bi-LSTMs) for sequential data processing.
Attention Mechanisms to enhance context understanding.
Output Layer to extract answers based on start and end pointers.

Colab Notebook
To try out the BiDAF model directly, access the Colab notebook and run it in Google Colab. This notebook allows users to run the model without any local setup, making it easy to explore the reimplementation.
